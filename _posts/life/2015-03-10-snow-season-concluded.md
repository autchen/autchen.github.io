This is the first winter I struggled learning snowboarding. It's thrilling, expensive and dangerous. I even bumped my arm on the beginner's trail, and that was a painful experience. But anyway, it did not stop me from feeling the freedom of fleeting down the mountain. Not having enough of the fun, the temperature raised and the trail conditions are getting bad. Next season, defintely devote more time to it.
