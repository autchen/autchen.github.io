Wow, this couldn't be any better. 

Gaswork park at Seattle, Jul 15, 2015. Shaky shot with cheap cellphone.

I was sad about not being able to attend the conference at some random Irish village, but this definitely compensate well. After some cliche American event foods (dogs, mac n cheese, sigh..) and long waiting by the lake, finally the Maroon5 performance save the day. I am not a big fan of concerts, but being able to see in action what the radios have repeated 1000 times is still kind of exciting.

The event end with a Surface3 as the gift. Not so useful a device, but much appreciated as a gift. Microsoft is really pumping a lot of money in the summer intern programs.
