There were another vim plugin [post](http://autchen.github.io/guides/2015/03/06/vim-plugin.html) last year for C development. The collection was somewhat out-of-date, though it does not depends on many external tools (git, python, etc). I have upgraded the collection a lot lately to make it morden, and also support development with Python.

### Installation

Requirements: vim compiled with python support, [git](https://git-scm.com/).

Optional: [python-jedi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jedi), [python-flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8), [clang](http://clang.org/)

Download this [vimrc](https://github.com/autchen/autchen.github.io/blob/master/resources/tools/_vimrc?raw=true) file.

Clone Vundle to vim folder

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
vim
{% endhighlight %}

In vim command, input ```:PluginInstall<CR>```, the plugins should be automatically installed.
