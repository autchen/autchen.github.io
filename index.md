### PROFILE
I am currently a research assistant at the AMPS Lab at Syracuse University. My advisor is [Dr. Qinru Qiu](http://hydrogen.syr.edu/~qqiu/). Generally, my research interests are machine learning, cognitive applications and high performance computing on heterogeneous systems. In particular, I am working on anomaly detections using neuromorphic models as well as their acceleration and scalability.
