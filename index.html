<p>I am currently a research assistant at the AMPS Lab at Syracuse University. My advisor is <a href="http://hydrogen.syr.edu/%7Eqqiu/">Dr. Qinru Qiu</a>. Generally, my research interests are machine learning, cognitive applications and high performance computing on heterogeneous systems. In particular, I am working on anomaly detections using neuromorphic models as well as their acceleration and scalability. </p>
